So, Do you believe the cultural content in the SSC English textbook is relevant to your life and experiences? How?

Yes, it is somewhat related to me, since it contains some components of my culture,
So I can relate to it somehow.

How do you relate it?

Since it contains the components of my culture, the history of my culture,
so I know them and I can assure that it is my culture, so I can relate to it.

Does the textbook's cultural content assist you understand diverse cultures and perspectives? How?

It does assist me in some form, but I don't think it is enough, because as much as I know,
it is not enough for me to use in the real world.


To what extent do the textbook's cultural contents stimulate your interest in learning English? 

It is not that much, since I cannot use it in other fields of life.

I mean, it's not stimilates your interest in learning english, 

It does, but it isn't enough.


Do you believe that the textbook's cultural element makes English learning more interesting and engaging? Explain how.

Yes, it does.
Because if I get to learn about any other culture, I'd be interested in learning about them,
and since English is an international language,
I can use English to learn about that culture.


Can you explain how the textbook's cultural content helps you build a global perspective?

The textbook's Cultural Content helps me learn about different cultures, and I can picture them,
and they may be different from my culture, but since they're all humans, so I can relate to them.


Do you have any more comments or recommendations about the cultural content of the SSC English textbook? 

I don't think that this would satisfy the need of the students, since it does not contain the components of other diverse cultures.
So if we got to know about more diverse cultures, maybe the students will be more interested in learning the languages, and also practicing English.
